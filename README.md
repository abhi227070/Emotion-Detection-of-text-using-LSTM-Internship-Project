## Introduction

Emotion Detection for Text using LSTM leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze the sentiment of textual data. By training LSTM models on labeled text data, this project aims to accurately detect the emotional content of text data.

## Technologies/Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

## Description

The project preprocesses text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and stemming the words to enhance the accuracy of emotion detection. It then utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to classify the text into predefined emotional categories. The model is trained on labeled text data to learn the patterns associated with each emotion.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-detection-text-lstm.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
